      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>         
        This wireframe demonstates what who the founder of Utah Beach is and what he aims to accomplish. We can add anyone to this as consultants or something akin. At the request of the owner, we can add our partners and any affiliate beneath frontpage leadership. This frontpage leadership would obviously center around the founder.

        This page will show the coverage map for UtahBeach. It will also include links, contact information, and processes for getting in contact. The footer displays only two social media icons. If the owner wants to focus on just two media avenues, this give him an idea of what it may look like.
